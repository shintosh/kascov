//! KCC20 token accounting: a deterministic derivation of per-token supply,
//! balances, event classification, and rule-validation verdicts from
//! `covenant_events` + `covenant_utxos` alone.
//!
//! Design contract (the conservative core of the feature):
//!
//! * One pure function, [`derive_token`], recomputes a token's entire derived
//!   state from the two source tables. The write hook in `Store::apply`, the
//!   reorg rewind in `Store::rollback`, and the versioned boot pass
//!   [`Store::derive_tokens_if_stale`] all call it — one truth, no
//!   incremental delta-patcher that could drift (spend-time reveals
//!   retro-resolve cells created by earlier events, so incremental code would
//!   rewrite history rows anyway).
//! * A token is `verified` ONLY when every event in its history classified
//!   against a known KCC20 rule with every input/output state hash-proven,
//!   no conservation/minter violation, and the live frontier sums exactly to
//!   genesis + mints − burns. Anything unknown or ambiguous is `unvalidated`
//!   with the first reason stamped; `invalid` is reserved for hash-proven
//!   rule violations. Never a false "verified".
//! * States are proven three ways, all proof-grade: a bare consensus state
//!   script that decodes as a KCC20 build; a spend-time P2SH reveal
//!   (blake2b-verified against the committed hash); or witness recovery —
//!   the spending tx's sigscript carries the new states as struct-of-arrays
//!   pushes, and splicing candidate fields into a same-build program is
//!   accepted iff the splice hashes to the output's committed hash
//!   ([`kascov_decode::kcc20::prove_output_state`]). Hash equality is the
//!   sole acceptance criterion, so a misparse fails closed.
//! * Event order: token events anchor exclusively to the token covenant's
//!   own `covenant_events` rows, whose `seq` is a total order that agrees
//!   with the canonical (accepting_daa, tx_index) feed order for a single
//!   covenant — so pre-capture NULL `tx_index` rows never make ordering
//!   ambiguous here, and the per-tx conservation checks are order-free
//!   anyway. Minter (vault) covenants link through `token_minters` instead
//!   of injecting a second event stream.
